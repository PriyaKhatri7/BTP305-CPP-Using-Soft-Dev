       <p>In this workshop, you implement linkage, storage duration, namespaces,
       guards, and operating system interfaces.</p>
       <br />

       <p class="section">Learning Outcome</p>

       <p>Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have
       demonstrated the abilities to</p>

       <ul>
        <li>link to a variable in another translation unit</li>

        <li>declare a local variable that lasts the lifetime of the program</li>

        <li>guard a class definition from repetition</li>

        <li>define a class within its own namespace</li>

        <li>pass arguments to a program from the command line</li>

        <li>describe to your instructor what you have learned in this workshop</li>
       </ul>
       <br />

       <p class="section">Specifications</p>

       <p>This workshop consists of three modules:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><span class=code>w1</span></li>
       <li><span class=code>Process</span></li>
       <li><span class=code>CString</span></li>
       </ul>

       <p class="ssection">CString Module</p>

       <p>Code a class named <span class="code">CString</span> that
       encapsulates a C-style null-terminated string.&nbsp; Include
       separate header and implementation files for your module.&nbsp;
       Wrap your header file in a conditional pre-processor macro that
       prevents repeated access.&nbsp; Embed your class definition and
       its implementation in namespace <span class=code>sict</span>.&nbsp;
       In your header file, alongside your class definition, define an
       unmodifiable variable named <span class=code>MAX_CHAR</span> that
       holds the number of characters to be stored in a
       <span class="code">CString</span> object excluding the null byte.&nbsp;
       Set the value of that variable to <span class=code>14</span>.
       </p>
       <p>
       Include in or with your class definition:
       </p>

       <ul>
        <li>a constructor that receives optionally the address of an unmodifiable
        C-style null-terminated string and stores up to the maximum number of
        characters specified.&nbsp; Your constructor defaults to an empty
        string and checks for receipt of the null address.&nbsp;
        Yourr constructor stores an empty string if the address received is
        the null address.</li>

        <li>a member query named <span class=code>display()</span>that receives
        a reference to an <span class="code">ostream</span> object and inserts into
        that object the string stored in your <span class=code>CString</span> object.&nbsp;
        </li>

        <li>a non-friend helper operator that inserts the stored string into the left
        <span class=code>ostream</span> operand of an insertion expression.&nbsp; This
        operator prefaces the string with an insertion counter and increments that counter.&nbsp;
        Before the very first string only, this operator inserts a one-line heading as
        shown below.&nbsp; The initial value for the counter is set outside your
        module.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       Do not use the <span class=code>string</span> class of the standard library
       in this workshop.&nbsp; You may use the <span class=code>cstring</span> functions.
       </p>
       <p>
       Include in your implementation file:
       </p>
       <ul>
       <li>the definition of a global variable that holds the initial value of the
       record counter.&nbsp;
       </li>
       </ul>

       <p class="ssection">Process Module</p>

       <p>The <span class=code>Process</span> module consists of a single function that
       receives the address of a C-style null-terminated string, creates a
       <span class=code>CString</span> object using the string, and inserts
       the object into the output stream.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       You can find copies of the header and implementation files for this module
       <a href="345_w1_Process.h">here</a> and <a href="345_w1_Process.cpp">here</a> respectively.
       </p>

       <p class="ssection">w1 Module</p>

       <p>Code the implementation file for a <span class="code">main()</span>
       function that receives the name of an input file as a command-line
       argument.&nbsp; Your function echoes the command-line input, checks
       for the correct number of command-line arguments, and if successful,
       attempts to open the named file for reading.&nbsp;
       </p>
       <p>
       If successful, your function reads a record from the file.&nbsp; If your
       function has read the record successfully, it passes the address of the
       record to the <span class=code>process</span> function of the
       <span class=code>Process</span> module.&nbsp; Your function continues extracting
       records from the file until it has read all of them.&nbsp; You
       may assume that any record in any file available will never contain
       more than 1000 characters.
       </p>
       <p>
       If the user has not entered enough arguments, your function inserts an error
       message into the error stream and terminates execution.&nbsp; If the user has
       entered too many arguments, your function inserts an error message into the error
       stream and terminates execution.&nbsp; If your function fails to open the named
       file for reading, your function inserts an error message into the error stream
       and terminates execution.&nbsp; Sample error messages are shown below:
       </p>
       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre class="result">
 Command Line : w1

 *** Insufficient number of arguments ***
 Usage: w1 filename

 Command Line : w1 file1.dat file2.dat

 *** Too many arguments ***

 Command Line : w1 file1.dat

 *** Failed to open file file1.dat ***
 </pre>
         </td>
        </tr>
       </table>

       <p>
       Define a global variable that holds the initial value of the
       record counter and initialize that variable to the value
       <span class=code>10</span>.
       </p>

       <p class="ssection">Input File</p>

       <p>The input file for your program is named <span class=code>Courses.dat</span>.&nbsp;
       You can find a copy of this file <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/~btp305/pages/workshops/Courses.dat">here</a>.</p>

       <p class="ssection">Sample Output</p>

       <p>The output from a successful run of your program looks like:</p>

       <table width="45%" summary="">
        <tr>
         <td>
          <pre class="result">

       </p>
       <p>
       Unless otherwise stated by your instructor, your submission
       should include the following components:
       </p>
       <ol>
       <li>source code for your <span class=code>w1</span> module</li>
       <li>source code for your <span class=code>Process</span> module</li>
       <li>source code for your <span class=code>CString</span> module</li>
       <li>a text file named <span class=code>reflect.txt</span> that
       includes your answers to the following questions:
       <ul>
       <li>identify the linkage, if any, between your modules</li>
       <li>identify the storage duration of the variable that keeps track
       of the record number in the insertion operator for your
       <span class=code>CString</span> class.</li>
       <li>what did you learn in completing this workshop?</li>
       </ul>
       </ol>

       <p class="ssection">Bonus (20%)</p>
       <p>
       Convert your implementation of the <span class=code>CString</span>
       class to accept and store a C-style null-terminated string of any
       length supplied by the client code.&nbsp; Ensure that there are no
       memory leaks in your upgrade and that both copying and copy assigning
       facilities are supported.&nbsp;
